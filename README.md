# NFInsight Analytics

This is the repo for NFInsight's ETL and Analytics server.

To run, simply follow these steps:

1. Clone the repo.
2. Create a virtual environment within the directory. We recommend using Python 3.10.
3. Activate the virtual environment.
4. Run these commands:

```shell
cp ./app/.env.example ./app/.env
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The server should be up and running. To visit the OpenAPI spec, simply go to `127.0.0.1:8000/docs` in your browser.
